Analysis of the ransom demands from Shodan results

I've provided a script that you can use as a basis for your own analysis, or to update and gather more results as Shodan scrapes them. I've also included a python script that can be used to query the blockstream.info API for any wallet addresses with associated transactions.

At the time of this publication, there were over 500 results. Those results can be found in the provided CSV where the Ransom amount, Bitcoin wallet, and TOX ID are all listed.
